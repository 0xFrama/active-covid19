What is missing in the 'preprocessed-58k' folder is the 'frames' folder which needs to be present in order to run the code.

The 'frames' folder contains all the necessary frames (as numpy arrays) to perform training and testing.

The 'segmentation frames' folder contains all the groundtruths frames (black and white one-channel images,  as numpy arrays). 

This code runs better on a GPU.
In order to use a specific GPU (for example, with id 0) to run the code, use:

			CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py

if no GPU is available, the code can run on CPU too:
			
			python main.py
